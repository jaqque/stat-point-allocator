Stat Point Allocator.

Good luck.

Setup
-----


Make a Virtual Environment. Probably not in this repo. But whatever. If you do
it in this repo, name it SPA. We already ignore that.


```bash
python3 -m venv SPA
source SPA/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Deploying to Heroku? Get the CLI!
`curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install.sh | sh`
